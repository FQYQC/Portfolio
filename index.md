# About Me

**I'm now a Master's student at [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/), [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), majoring in Machine Learning and Data Science.**

**I received my Bachelor's Degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) this year. At PKU, I'm a member of the first [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/) (an honorary pilot class in AI) at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/), and was also affiliated with [Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/).**

**My research and career interests include but are not limited to**

- **Research:** Machine Learning, (Machine and Human) Cognitive Reasoning, LLMs, Planning.
- **Industry:** Self-driving, Recommendation, Cloud/Distributed Computation, Data-driven Learning, Software Development, especially related to AI and AI products.
